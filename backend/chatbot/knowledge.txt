Here is a summarized list of 100 tips for managing kidney disease based on the documents in the knowledge base:

Increase Hemoglobin: Focus on nutrients like folic acid, vitamin B12, iron, protein, and erythropoietin​​.
Vitamin D Supplementation: Take active form supplements daily to improve cold tolerance and body warmth​​.
Wear Warm Clothes: Use padded jackets and heating pads in cold weather to maintain body warmth​​.
Monitor Creatinine and Urea: Regularly check levels during winter as muscle contraction can increase creatinine​​.
Control Protein Intake: Limit protein to essential amounts to reduce creatinine production​​.
Choose Plant-Based Proteins: Opt for easily digestible proteins like lentils and milk​​.
Avoid Heavy Exercises: Engage in low-impact activities like walking or yoga​​.
Manage Fever: Treat fever promptly to avoid elevated creatinine due to muscle pain and fatigue​​.
Understand GFR: Focus on reducing creatinine to improve GFR, which inversely affects each other​​.
Control High Blood Pressure and Diabetes: Keep blood pressure and sugar levels in check to prevent further kidney damage​​.
Use Leaching for Vegetables: Soak chopped vegetables in water for 4-5 hours to remove excess potassium​​.
Balance Nutrients: Be aware that leaching also removes other essential nutrients, so consume naturally low-potassium foods​​.
Consume Low-Potassium Foods: Avoid vegetables like potatoes and sweet potatoes, and prefer radish, carrot, garlic, and onion​​.
Avoid Leafy Vegetables in Sauce: They may have high potassium levels when concentrated​​.
Avoid Rock Salt: Use normal salt to prevent added potassium intake​​.

Use Phosphorus Binders: Take them with meals to prevent phosphorus absorption​​.
Take Calcium Supplements: Ensure adequate calcium intake to strengthen bones​​.
Active Vitamin D Supplements: Use calcitriol to enhance calcium absorption​​.
Manage Blood Pressure and Blood Sugar: Crucial for improving kidney function and reducing waste product accumulation​​.
Diet for Reducing Creatinine: Focus on easily digestible proteins and avoid high-protein foods​​.
Avoid Fried Foods: They increase urea production in the liver​​.
Consume Light Foods: Prefer rice, chapati, and bread to reduce urea levels​​.
Avoid High-Potassium Vegetables: Exclude potatoes, cauliflower, and other tuberous vegetables​​.
Avoid Citric Fruits: Oranges, grapes, and mangoes can lead to metabolic acidosis​​.
Control Fluid Intake: Drink small amounts frequently to manage hydration without overloading the kidneys​​.
